# Our Design System

The SSE design system is comprised of three elemental parts: **foundations**, **components** and **patterns**. Deliberately basic, the nature of this system allows for flexibility in execution, ensuring that our work is **consistent but not uniform**.

## Foundations

Foundations are the building blocks of SSE Digital design. They're the DNA of the SSE Digital Brand and are evident in everything we create. Examples include colours, typography and how we request or present certain data types.
