# Our Design System

## We aim to be consistent, not uniform

The SSE design system is comprised of three elemental parts: **foundations**, **components** and **patterns**. Deliberately basic, the nature of this system allows for flexibility in execution, ensuring that our work is **consistent but not uniform**. Consistency is important as it ensures our products remain familiar, but it should never be at the sacrifice of appropriateness.

## Foundations

Foundations are the building blocks of SSE Digital design. They're the DNA of the SSE Digital Brand and are evident in everything we create. Examples include colours, typography and how we request or present certain data types.

## Components

Components are distinctive UI elements that are used repeatedly throughout our digital products. Examples include buttons, form inputs, toggles and tooltips. Consistent UI components make a huge difference in guiding a user through a product smoothly and efficiently.

## Patterns

Patterns are recurring element\(s\) that appear throughout our products. Examples include navigation, cards, forms and modal windows. Maintaining consistency in pattern usage ensures our products remain familiar and usable.
