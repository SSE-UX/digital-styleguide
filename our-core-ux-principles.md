# Core UX Principles

## Design for all

**We design our digital services for everyone, regardless of disability or impairment. We always strive to meet WCAG AA standards.**

Accessible design is good design. Everything we create should be as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. This sometimes mean we need to sacrifice design elegance, but this is a trade-off we should be comfortable making – "usable but inelegant" is far better than "beautiful but unusable".

Our users have a wide range of digital literacy, and not all will be used to using websites, apps or other digital products to the same level we're used to. We should design with this in mind.

## We do the hard work

**Analytics and user-testing shows us how we can improve existing experiences and informs new designs with users at the heart.**

Making something look simple is easy. Making something simple to use is much harder - especially when the underlying systems are complex - but that’s what we should be doing. Don’t take “It’s always been that way” for an answer. It’s usually more and harder work to make things simple, but it’s the right thing to do.  


## Be human

People aren’t specialists in our products and services, so we shouldn’t speak to them like they are. No jargon or confusing interactions. Just simple, easy to understand language.

## Clarity over clutter

Our digital experiences are designed to be clear and simple to use, nothing un-necessary.

## Drive the action

We aim to guide our customers through clear and easy to understand journeys. Making the action obvious with a clear purpose.
