# Core UX Principles

## Design for All

**We design our digital services for everyone, regardless of disability or impairment. We always strive to meet WCAG AA standards.**

Everything we create should be as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. We always design with accessibility in mind. This sometimes mean we need to sacrifice design elegance, but this is a trade-off we should be comfortable making – "usable but inelegant" is better than "beautiful but unusable".

Our users have a wide range of digital literacy, and not all will be used to using websites, apps or other digital products to the same level we may be used to. We should design with this in mind and pay careful attention to language, colour & composition.

## We Do the Hard Work

**Analytics and user-testing shows us how we can improve existing experiences and informs new designs with users at the heart.**

Our job is to make things simple to use and easy to understand. That's not always easy, especially when the underlying systems or products are themselves complex, but it's the right thing to do.

We should strive to acquire a deep understanding of the problems we're trying to solve, otherwise we won't build the right thing. Doing research, analysing data and engaging users will help develop this understanding. Don't make assumptions. Have empathy for users, and remember that what they ask for isn’t always what they need.

## Be Human

**People aren’t specialists in our products and services, so we shouldn’t speak to them like they are. No jargon or confusing interactions. Just simple, easy to understand language.**

Have empathy for users, and remember that what they ask for isn’t always what they need.

## Clarity Over Clutter

Our digital experiences are designed to be clear and simple to use, nothing un-necessary.

## Drive the Action

We aim to guide our customers through clear and easy to understand journeys. Making the action obvious with a clear purpose.
