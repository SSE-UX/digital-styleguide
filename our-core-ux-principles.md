# Core UX Principles

## Design for All

**We design our digital services for everyone, regardless of disability or impairment. We always strive to meet WCAG AA standards.**

Everything we create should be as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. We always design with accessibility in mind. This sometimes mean we need to sacrifice design elegance, but this is a trade-off we should be comfortable making – "usable but inelegant" is better than "beautiful but unusable".

Our users have a wide range of digital literacy, and not all will be used to using websites, apps or other digital products to the same level we may be used to. We should design with this in mind and pay careful attention to language, colour & composition.

## We Do the Hard Work

**Analytics and user-testing shows us how we can improve existing experiences and informs new designs with users at the heart.**

Our job is to make things simple to use and easy to understand. That's not always easy, especially when the underlying systems or products are themselves complex, but it's the right thing to do.

We should strive to acquire a deep understanding of the problems we're trying to solve, otherwise we won't build the right thing. Doing research, analysing data and engaging users will help develop this understanding. Don't make assumptions. Have empathy for users, and remember that what they ask for isn’t always what they need.

## Be Human

**People aren’t specialists in our products and services, so we shouldn’t speak to them like they are. No jargon or confusing interactions. Just simple, easy to understand language.**

We live & breathe our products and systems, but our users do not. They don't understand acronyms or industry jargon so we shouldn't use them. Everything we create should be a reflection of how humans interact with one another: simple language, clear & obvious processes, helpful content. How well we communicate is determined not by how well we say things, but by how well we are understood.

## Clarity Over Clutter

**Our digital experiences are designed to be clear and simple to use, nothing un-necessary.**

Everything we create should have a purpose. We understand that things like white space are design elements that help improve the usability of our work, giving our designs the space they need to breathe.

## Drive the Action

**We aim to guide our customers through clear and easy to understand journeys. Making the action obvious with a clear purpose.**

Where there is an action to be taken, our designs will give them the right context to allow users to make informed decisions. Where there are options to choose from, our designs will help guide users towards making the right choices.
