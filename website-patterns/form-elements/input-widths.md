# Widths & Spacing

The width of an input element \(e.g. text field or dropdown menu\) gives the user an instant visual clue as to the length of information required.

* **Small:** inputs of 2 characters only \(e.g. number between 1-99\)
* **Medium:** inputs that are longer than 2 characers but still relatively short \(e.g. title\)
* **Large:** everything else
