# Disclaimers & Qualifiers



If a specific piece of information requires further clarification, disclaimers or qualifiers, we handle this by presenting an accordian at the bottom of the page.

We don't use asterisks, footnotes or other textual decorations to indicate where more information is available. This maintains readbility of our content and the clarity of its presentation.
