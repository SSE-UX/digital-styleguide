  We often get image assets from third-party agencies. Knowing what formats to
  ask for allows us to rework imagery if necessary to fit our digital spaces.

# Imagery & External Agencies

## Preferred formats

We always prefer to receive imagery as high-resolution layered PSD files, preferably with separate JPEGs/PNGs showing the final artwork treatment.

### High-resolution

Our largest hero image size spans 1600px @2x pixel density â€“ that's a physical size of 3200px. To maintain quality on retina-calibre displays, this is the minimum size we ask for.

### Layered PSD file

The three breakpoints each require a slightly different composition of image, so the more flexibility we have to compose by using a layered PSD supplied by the agency, the better our final digital imagery will be.

### The final artwork treatment

Although not essential, it sometimes helps us to understand what the final treatment looks like so that we can maintain any essential elements as we transfer the artwork to our digital spaces.
