# Homepage Hero

The homepage hero contains the primary message for the SSE homepage. When creating imagery for this asset, either yourself or via a third-party agency, follow these guidelines to ensure your imagery works across all breakpoints and devices.

## Hero image sizing

There are three sizes of hero image for the various breakpoints. When preparing new imagery for the homepage hero, you'll need to create assets at these sizes:

* 768px by 295px
* 992px by 580px
* 1600px by 400px

**We have PSD templates for each size which you must use to compose, store and export your imagery.** This ensures all homepage hero imagery is contained in the same place. Speak to a member of the UX team to access the templates.

### Small \(768 x 295 @2x\)

At the small breakpoint, the homepage hero is a fixed height with a panel that covers the bottom half of the image. This is shown below as the 'non-safe area'.

The non-safe area of this image is where the white panel containing the message  text sits, so ensure that the main focus of your image sits outside this area.

In the example above, the image has been appropriately composed so that the main area of interest within the image is positioned above the non-safe area, ensuring it's visible when published on the site. 

The image below has not been appropriately composed, resulting in parts of the image not being visible when published.

### Medium \(992 x 580 @2x\)

The medium image size has the same sort of non-safe area as the small image does, and the same rules apply.

As with the small breakpoint, ensure the area of interest is not obscured by the non-safe area to ensure it looks as expected when published.

### Large \(1600 x 400 @2x\)

The large version of the homepage hero does not use a panel to house the message content â€“ the content floats to the left of the hero image. Care should still be taken to ensure the area of interest is focused on the right-hand side of the image. Note also that the blue utility bar overhangs the hero image slightly.

Another consideration with the large breakpoint is to ensure there's sufficient contrast within the non-safe area for the message text. The text will either be $primaryblue or white, so ensure that whatever parts of the hero image sit underneath the non-safe area remain AA compliant.

To ensure sufficient contrast and maintain readability of the message text, you might need to consider adding a white gradient to the left of your hero image, blurring the background or changing the opacity of the image.

## Exporting imagery

Care should be taken to ensure that any imagery created for the hero space does not have an excessively large filesize. The following export settings should be used as a guide.

| Breakpoint | Export settings |
| :--- | :--- |
| Small | Progressive JPEG; 50% quality |
| Medium | Progressive JPEG; 50% quality |
| Large | Progressive JPEG; 30% quality |

There'll be a trade-off between filesize and image quality which will vary from image to image, so common sense and a keen eye should dictate how to balance this for each image. Take special care if your image contains strong gradients as these tend to degrade to more 'banded' blocks of colour as the quality lessens.

## Previewing your imagery

Once you've supplied your hero imagery, you should ask to see it in-situ in a browser. Change the size of the browser to explore the different breakpoint: does your image behave as expected? Do you need to alter the composition of any of the breakpoints? Does it load in a suitable time?
