# Preparing & Exporting Imagery

## Preparing imagery

Take care when preparing imagery that it's fit for purpose and meets the guidelines set out in this document depending on what your imagery is to be used for.

## Exporting imagery

Care should be taken to ensure that any imagery created for the hero space does not have an excessively large filesize. Tweak the Photoshop export settings to get the right balance between filesize and image quality. Although there isn't a 'one size fits all' solution, the following export settings can be used as a guide.

| Breakpoint | Export settings |
| :--- | :--- |
| Small | Progressive JPEG; 50% quality |
| Medium | Progressive JPEG; 50% quality |
| Large | Progressive JPEG; 30% quality |

There'll be a trade-off between filesize and image quality which will vary from image to image, so common sense and a keen eye should dictate how to balance this for each image. Take special care if your image contains strong gradients as these tend to degrade to more 'banded' blocks of colour as the quality lessens.

## Previewing your imagery

Once you've supplied your hero imagery, you should ask to see it in-situ in a browser. Change the size of the browser to explore the different breakpoint: does your image behave as expected? Do you need to alter the composition of any of the breakpoints? Does it load in a suitable time?
