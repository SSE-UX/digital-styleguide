# General Content Guidelines

## Use natural, conversational language

Choosing everyday words over formal ones helps us sound like friendly people instead of a stuffy company. Think about how you’d talk to your user if you were sitting in front of them.

## Clichés and corporate jargon

Avoid jargon. Always choose more straightforward, natural words & language.

## Use contractions & conjunctions

Contractions help our sentences flow naturally and make sure we sound human and personal: we’ve, he’s, don’t, haven’t, etc. You don’t need to use contractions every time – read your sentences out loud to see if they flow properly. And steer clear of unusual contractions that go too far: could’ve, mightn’t, wouldn’t’ve.

There’s nothing wrong with starting sentences with conjunctions like ‘and’, ‘but’ and ‘or’. This is grammatically correct and is more common these days – in fact, it can be a useful way  
to add a bit of energy to your writing. But use them sparingly and make sure they’re followed by complete sentences.

## Be proactive

Being proactive also helps us focus firmly on people. Our customers don’t care about our internal processes or policies, they just want to know what it means for them. This helps us sound more personal and caring.

You’ll appear more human if you sound like you, rather than a detached company representative. So use active language with plenty of ‘we’ and ‘you’. It’s livelier, clearer and easier to read.

## Keep sentences to the point

If sentences are wordy and long, they’ll lack energy and be harder to follow. Keeping sentences tight and snappy makes writing more engaging and is much easier to read.

## Be positive

We’re upbeat, energetic and enthusiastic – always keen to make life better for our customers. And phrasing things positively helps us show this passion, and gives our customers a reason to smile.

## Keep it fresh

Look for new ways to say things, instead of falling back on clichés and repetitive phrasing. We’re not jaded and indifferent, we’re people who really care and using fresh, natural wording helps us show that.

## Use bold, confident phrasing

Be confident and bold with your language, wherever you can be. We never want to sound evasive or uncertain, as this stops us sounding open and trustworthy.

## Use straightforward, clear language

Always use language our customers will understand, and never hide behind legal wording, technical terms or jargon. We want to simplify and demystify our products, services and industry so our customers know exactly what’s what. This helps us sound upfront and open.

## Avoid acronyms

Don’t use internal or industry acronyms, unless you’re sure your reader will understand. And even then, if there’s a more everyday or natural way of saying it, choose the more conversational option. If you have to use an acronym, make sure you spell it out and explain it in everyday language the first time.
