# Common Word & Phrases

## Email

Write email, not e-mail. If you’re writing an email address at the end of a sentence, it’s fine to follow it with a full stop.

## Log in or login?

If you’re using it as an adjective, it’s login:

> I've forgotten my login details

If it’s a verb, it’s log in:

> Please log in to your account
