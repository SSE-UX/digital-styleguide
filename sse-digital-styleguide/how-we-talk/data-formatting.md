# Common Data Formatting

## General guidelines

* Don’t design a UI to fit the words you have, design a UI that will fit any words or numbers it may need to. Consider all scenarios.
* Think ‘responsively’ — design a UI that won’t break under any ‘strain’, be it browser width or the amount of text presented.
* Think about vertical space — if your UI needs to cater for more lines of text, how well does the text wrap? Can it wrap? Should it?

## Date formatting

### Numerical Format for Dates

* Use 4 digits for the year, so as not to be mistaken for a day or month.
* Use the UK date format \(dd/mm/yyyy\).

### **Written Format for Dates**

* Use 2 digits for the date \(e.g. use '03' for the 3rd of the month, not '3'\)
* Don’t suffix a date with “th”, “st” or “rd” \(e.g. use 24, not 24th\), as this can be problematic for different languages and adds visual clutter for no additional benefit.
* Dates for today and tomorrow can be expressed as “today” or “tomorrow”. Dates further in the future, or in the past should be expressed more explicitly.
* Months can be shortened to three characters if & when required. 
* Use your discretion as to whether a date should also include a year.

| Use | Instead of |
| :--- | :--- |
| 03 May 2018 | 3rd May 2018 |
| 03 August 2018 | August 3rd |
| 03 Aug 2018 | 03 August 2018 \(if space dictates\) |

## Phone numbers

Write British numbers in full, making sure you use the area code. Make them easier to read by putting a space between each block.

There’s no need to use www, and you can finish with a full stop if the web address is at the end of a sentence
