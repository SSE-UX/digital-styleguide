# Tooltips

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: the design of this component is being updated in early 2019
{% endhint %}

Tooltips are used for small amounts of supporting text that is useful but doesn’t need to be visible at all times. Content within tooltips should be no more than a sentence or two lines – if your content is longer, use a modal to house it. Modals can be invoked from the same 'i' icon as tooltips.
