# Calls-to-Action

## Button labels

Button labels should always be clear, descriptive, action-orientated and short. Try to use a maximum of 2-3 words to convey what each button does.

**Context is important:** the page the button sits on will give your button labels additional context, so always consider this when assigning labels to buttons. 

For example, within a registration flow where the user is setting up a service, the final screen that completes the process could contain a button labelled "Finish" – this makes it clear the user is almost done. However, within a different process \(e.g. making a payment\) a button labelled "Finish" does not provide enough context or reassurance for a user – have they made the payment? Will they have a chance to review it first? Are they done yet? In that instance, a button labeled "Make payment" is much more appropriate.

Button labels are always **Sentence case**.

## Hierarchy

An appropriate hierarchy of calls to action helps to guide users through an interface. Presenting two options with the same visual weighting creates an unnecessary stumbling block for the user. For this reason, we have two styles of button: primary and secondary.

The primary action should always be presented to the left of the secondary action, or above/below if the buttons are stacked in a narrow column. The two actions should also be visually distinct to avoid creating confusion.
