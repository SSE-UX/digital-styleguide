## Contractions

Contractions shorten two words by adding an apostrophe like it’s or isn’t. We use contractions to give our writing  a more natural, human tone – words like "I’ve", "we’ve" and "you’ll". You don’t have to use them all the time, the trick is to read your text out loud to make sure it sounds natural and that it flows properly.

## Common terms

### Email

Write email, not e-mail. If you’re writing an email address at the end of a sentence, it’s fine to follow it with a full stop.

### Log in or login?

If you’re using it as an adjective, it’s login:

> I've forgotten my login details

If it’s a verb, it’s log in:

> Please log in to your account
