# Colours

## Colour composition

Generally speaking, we  use white as the dominant colour and overlay the SSE brand colours on top. This maintains readability, reduces eyestrain for our users and ensures consistency across our products and communications.

## Using colours

These colours form the core palette for all SSE digital products. Where appropriate, examples of usage are given but these are not absolute – refer to any supplied Sketch files or Zeplin links for specific usage.

{% hint style="info" %}
Colours are referred to throughout these digital guidelines using their **variable name** shown in the colour tables below.

SSE's primary brand colors are used in all digital products. **These colours are** [**WCAG 2.0 AA compliant** ↗](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast) **when contrasted with white.**

## Gradients

{% hint style="warning" %}
Gradients are likely being depreciated, so should not be overly used in any new design work
{% endhint %}

A gradient should only be used as a decorative element. **Do not place text over gradients.**

## Checking colour contrast

When using colour combinations, always check that their contrast is at least AA compliant. There are many online contrast checkers, but a nice one to use is [Accessible Colors ↗](http://accessible-colors.com)as it'll offer compliant suggestions if you enter a colour that isn't compliant.
