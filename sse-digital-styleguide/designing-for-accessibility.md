# Designing for Accessibility

We strive to design for all, and that requires a good working knowledge of designing for accessibility. We aim for [WCAG AA compliance↗](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) across all our digital products.

## Colour Contrast

Ensuring that there is sufficient contrast between colours is essential for maintaining readability, particularly for users with poor vision. Our brand colours have been optimised to be AA compliant when used on white.

### Testing colour contrast

Our preferred tool for testing colour contrast is [https://accessible-colors.com↗](https://accessible-colors.com) as it offers alternative colours if the ones you input are not accessible.
