# The SSE Digital Library

We have a master Sketch library containing all the assets needed to create SSE digital products. Once [you've added it as a library](adding-the-sse-digital-library-to-sketch.md), you'll have everything you need to do your work.

The library is a living, breathing document that we add to as & when we need. When updates are available, [Sketch will tell you](staying-up-to-date.md).
