  Sketch is our UI design tool. It's fast, perfect for UI work and gets regular
  updates. It integrates nicely with a bunch of other tools we use and is
  eminently extendable via plugins.

# Sketch

## Downloading Sketch

You can download the latest version of Sketch here: [https://sketchapp.com↗](https://sketchapp.com) . There's a 30 day fully functional free trial.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not use any pre-release or Beta versions of Sketch for your SSE work. They're often unreliable and using them makes it harder to collaborate with your colleagues.
{% endhint %}

## Setting up Sketch

Once installed, follow these steps to get Sketch all set up.

### 1. Turn off 'Auto Save'

This feature is turned on by default, so you'll need to manually go and turn it off in Sketch's preferences. **Please do this before opening any Sketch files.** Whilst it may seem like a good feature, it causes more problems than it solves:

* Imagine two people open the same Sketch file and turn various layers off or on to inspect the file. Sketch autosaves and now there are two versions of the same file, neither one in the state the designer left it.
* Files created in a newer version of Sketch cannot easily be opened in an older version, so if you have a newer version of Sketch and open a file, it means someone with an older version of Sketch cannot open it.
* Saving your work often should be part of our workflow. Software & systems are not infallible, so hit ⌘-S often!

### 2. Setup your workspace & plugins

Everyone has a unique way of working within Sketch, so take a moment to get it setup right for you. Get your toolbar the way you like it and install any plugins you normally use.

## Useful Sketch plugins

There are a variety of Sketch plugins we use to simplify aspects of our workflow.

### ~~Sketch Runner~~ \(Sketch runner is now a paid-for plugin\)

~~A powerful tool that allows you to run certain commands using keyboard shortcuts. This saves hunting through menus to find the commands you need. Once you've found which shortcuts you personally find useful, Runner starts to become a great time saver.~~

### Automate Sketch

A bunch of useful commands that aren't built into Sketch by default. It's great for doing things like "Remove all symbols that aren't being used in this document".

### Sketch Palettes

Allows you to import & export colour palettes. Use it with the master SSE colour palette.

### Symbol Instance Renamer

Rename symbol instances to the name of their master.
