# Homepage & Hub Hero Content

![H1, H2 and CTA are highlighted](../../.gitbook/assets/hub-content-banner.png)

There are three content elements that reside on the hero hubs, a H1, H2 and the CTA. When creating the content for these elements please follow these guidelines:

## H1 guidelines

* 30 characters including spaces
* Max two lines on a desktop
* Content layout size can be either 1/2 or 2/3, but ideally 1/2 to give the image focal point breathing space to the right of the content

#### Hub pages

* Hub page H1 should be the page title or describe the page contents and function to the customer. These guidelines should not be deviated from purely for SEO purposes.
* Hub page H1 should only be adapted if there's a strong business case

#### Homepage

* Homepage H1 content can change depending on business needs

## H2 guidelines

This content should describe the main objective of the page or any offers the business are looking to push to our customers that link to the CTA below

* 75 characters including spaces
* Max two lines on a desktop

{% hint style="info" %}
For both H1 and H2 the 'max two lines on a desktop' guideline is to ensure the content does not compromise the design on varying breakpoints, please ensure the new content is tested on tablet and mobile devices.
{% endhint %}

## CTA guidelines

* Two to three words
* Begin with an imperative such as "find", "get", "sign up" to set expectation to the customer

{% hint style="info" %}
If the CTA relies on the context of banner copy i.e. "Find out more", use the "Hidden text" field to add explanatory text for Accessibility.
{% endhint %}
