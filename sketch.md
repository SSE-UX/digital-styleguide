# Sketch

## Where to get Sketch

You can download the latest version of Sketch here: [https://sketchapp.com↗](https://sketchapp.com) . There's a 30 day fully functional free trial.

## Setting up Sketch

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### **Please turn off the 'autosave' feature in Sketch's preferences before opening any Sketch files**
{% endhint %}

This feature is turned on by default, so you'll need to manually go and turn it off. It's very easy to unwittingly make changes while viewing a Sketch file with the auto save on. Also, auto save doesn't play nicely with Adobe Creative Cloud storage, creating multiple 'conflicted copies', leading to clutter and confusion.

## Useful Sketch plugins

There are a variety of Sketch plugins we use to simplify aspects of our workflow.

### Sketch Runner

Sketch Runner is a powerful tool that allows you to run certain commands using keyboard shortcuts. This saves hunting through menus to find the commands you need. Once you've found which shortcuts you personally find useful, Runner starts to become a great time saver.

**Download:** [https://sketchrunner.com](https://sketchrunner.com/)[↗](https://sketchrunner.com/)

### Automate Sketch

Automate Sketch is a bunch of useful commands that aren't built into Sketch by default. It's great for doing things like "Remove all symbols that aren't being used in this document".
