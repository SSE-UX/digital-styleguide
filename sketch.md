## Where to get Sketch

You can download the latest version of Sketch here: [https://sketchapp.comâ†—](https://sketchapp.com) . There's a 30 day fully functional free trial.

## Auto save

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Please turn off the auto save feature in Sketch's preferences before opening any Sketch files**
{% endhint %}

This feature is turned on by default, so you'll need to manually go and turn it off. It's very easy to unwittingly make changes while viewing a Sketch file with the auto save on. Also, auto save doesn't play nicely with Adobe Creative Cloud storage, creating multiple 'conflicted copies', leading to clutter and confusion.
